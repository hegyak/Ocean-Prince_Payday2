PAYDAY 2 Art Gallery Painting Templates, by MP83
================================================

With these templates, replacing the paintings in
the Art Gallery/Framing Frame heist with custom
paintings will be a breeze (assuming that you know
how the mod_overrides and DDS file systems work).
Also included are some other art gallery templates.

Just pay attention to the following things:

1) Some of the images will be stretched by the game.
Such templates will have a warning text in them.

2) There's 83 unique paintings in the game files,
but 53 of them are unused by the base game.
To fix this, read the "List of paintings" text file.
